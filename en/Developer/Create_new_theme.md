# Create new theme

Themes are created using the [Twig](http://twig.sensiolabs.org/) template engine. Files are located in two different places depending on whether you're using v1 or v2 :

* With v1, you can find them in the `themes/` folder.
* Starting from v2, you'll need to go to the `src/Wallabag/CoreBundle/Resources/views/themes/` folder to find the template files. There are grouped by category.

Assets (imgs, js, css, fonts) can be found in the `public/` sub-folder.

All template files extend an unique file named `layout.html.twig`.
