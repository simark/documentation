# Download and install wallabag

## I don't want to install wallabag

If you can't or don't want to install Wallabag on your server, we suggest you create a free account on [Framabag](https://framabag.org/) which uses our software. [Read the full documentation](../User/Framabag_account_creation.md).

## I want to install wallabag

### I want to download wallabag manually

[Download the latest wallabag version](http://wllbg.org/latest) and unpack it:

    wget http://wllbg.org/latest
    unzip latest
    mv wallabag-version-number wallabag

Copy the files on your web server. For Ubuntu/Debian, it is the directory /var/www/html/ :

    sudo mv wallabag /var/www/html/

Then, jump off to next section.

### I want to download wallabag via composer

You need to install composer: 

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php

Next, on your web server, run this command: 

    composer create-project wallabag/wallabag . dev-master

All is downloaded into the current folder.

#### Prerequisites for your web server

Wallabag requires that several components to be installed on your web server.
To make sure your server has all the prerequisites, open in your browser the page
`http://monserveur.com/wallabag/index.php`.

The components are:   
 
* [PHP 5.3.3 or above](http://php.net/manual/fr/install.php) **with [PDO](http://php.net/manual/en/book.pdo.php) support**
* [XML for PHP](http://php.net/fr/xml)
* [PCRE](http://php.net/fr/pcre)
* [ZLib](http://php.net/en/zlib) (otherwise, the processing of compressed pages will be affected)
* [mbstring](http://php.net/en/mbstring) anb/or [iconv](http://php.net/en/iconv) (otherwise some pages will not be read - even in English)
* The [DOM/XML](http://php.net/manual/en/book.dom.php) extension
* [Data filtering](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.filter.php)
* [GD](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php) (otherwise, pictures will not be saved)
* [Tidy for PHP](http://php.net/fr/tidy) (otherwise, you may encounter problems with some pages)
* [cURL](http://php.net/fr/curl) with `Parallel URL fetching` (optionnal)
* [Parse ini file](http://uk.php.net/manual/en/function.parse-ini-file.php) 
* [allow_url_fopen](http://www.php.net/manual/fr/filesystem.configuration.php#ini.allow-url-fopen) (optionnal if cURL is installed)
* [gettext](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.gettext.php) (required for multi-language support)

Install the missing components before to proceed. For example, to install Tidy on Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt-get install php5-tidy
    sudo service apache2 reload

Note : if you're using IIS as a webserver, you have to disable *Anonymous Authentication* and [enable *Basic Authentication*](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc772009%28v=ws.10%29.aspx) in order to be able to login.

#### Twig installation
wallabag is build with Twig, a template library. You have to download it for wallabag to work. 
If you cannot install `composer` (for example in the case of shared hosting), we offer you to download a file which includes `Twig`. This file can be downloaed from the page `http://monserveur.com/wallabag/index.php` (section TWIG INSTALLATION) or directly at [http://wllbg.org/vendor](http://wllbg.org/vendor). Uncompress it in your wallabag directory.

Otherwise, you can use Composer to install `Twig` by launching `composer` from your wallabag directory (in the case of Ubuntu/Debian too: <code>/var/www/html/wallabag/</code>) by following the commands written on screen:

    curl -s http://getcomposer.org/installer | php
    php composer.phar install

#### Creation of the database.

Wallabag can be installed on different types of databases:

* [SQLite](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.sqlite.php). The easiest system of all. No extra configuration needed.
* [MySQL](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.mysql.php). A well known database system, which is in most cases more efficient than SQLite.
* [PostgreSQL](http://php.net/manual/fr/book.pgsql.php). Some people found it better than MySQL.

We advice you to use MySQL because it is more efficient. In this case, you should create a new database (for example `wallabag`),  a new user (for example  `wallabag`) and a password (here `YourPassWord`). To do this, you can use `phpMyAdmin`, or launch the following commands:

    mysql -p -u root
    mysql> CREATE DATABASE wallabag;
    mysql> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON `wallabag`.* TO 'wallabag'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'VotreMotdePasse';
    mysql> exit

*Note:* If you're using MySQL or Postgresql, you have to **fill all the fields**, otherwise the installation will not work and an error message will tell you what's wrong. You must create the database that you will use for wallabag manually with a tool like PHPMyAdmin or the console.

### Permissions

Your web server needs a writing access to the `assets`, `cache` and `db` directories. Otherwise, a message will report that the installation is impossible:

    sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html/wallabag

### Installation of wallabag. At last.

Access to wallabag from your web browser: `http://monserveur.com/wallabag`. If your server is correctly configured, you directly reach the setup screen. 

Select the type of database (`sqlite`, `mysql` or `postgresql`) and fill the information about your database. 
In the case of the databse MySQL created before, the standard configuration will be:

    Database engine:    MySQL
    Server:             localhost
    Database: 	        wallabag
    Username:	        wallabag
    Password:	        YourPassWord

Finally, Create your first user and his/her password (different from the database user).

Wallabag is now installed.

## Login

From your web browser, you reach the login screen: fill your username and your password to connect to your account.

Enjoy!
